# MQTT + ChatGPT Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate **ChatGPT** with the **MQTT protocol** to enable seamless natural language interaction between IoT devices and a conversational AI model.

Using the **OpenAI API**, the MQTT client receives messages from a subscribed topic, sends them to ChatGPT, and publishes the AI-generated responses back to a designated MQTT topic. This enables a continuous interaction cycle between IoT devices and ChatGPT.
